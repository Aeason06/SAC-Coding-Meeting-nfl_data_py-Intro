# SAC-Coding-Meeting-nfl_data_py-Intro
Unfortunately, installing this package kind of sucks. It works as intended on Python versions 3.10-12 but to save us from having to deal with installing new python versions we are going to try and get around that using this line to install nfl_data_py:
```Python
!pip install numpy>=2.0 pandas fastparquet appdirs && pip install nfl_data_py --no-deps
```
